# All k3s cluster hosts (wildcard pattern)

# Control plane
Host k3s-cp-01
  HostName 192.168.122.10

# Worker nodes
Host k3s-worker-01
  HostName 192.168.122.11

# Bastion host (jump box for cluster access)
Host k3s-bastion-01
  HostName 192.168.122.13

# Usage examples:
#   ssh k3s-bastion-01                    # Access bastion (run kubectl here)
#   ssh k3s-cp-01                          # Access control plane directly
#   ssh k3s-worker-01                      # Access worker node directly
#
# The bastion host is the recommended jump box for cluster management.
# It has kubectl, k9s, flux, and helm pre-installed.
